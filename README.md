# OecExamPractice
This is a Small App to generate and take practice quizzes &amp; tests from openly available question banks for "Outdoor Emergency Care 5th Edition", aka the text/test required to become Ski Patrol.

If you just want to use it, [here it is](http://brookp.me/OecExamPractice)

I put this togethor to see how I "test" for the OEC exam.  I wasn't thrilled with some of the other options out there in terms of simulating an actual exam.

The questions were scraped from freely available practice sets (see the webpage and the code for urls) into a json file, which is then loaded into a simple web UI to practice on and score.

I do not profit from this in any way.  The questions used were freely available, I did not write them.  I made this to help me and my OEC classmates study.

I also do not warranty it against bugs or errata, though I will accept pull requests.
